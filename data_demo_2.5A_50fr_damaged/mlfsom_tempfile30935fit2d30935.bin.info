Name of binary file containing image data = mlfsom_tempfile30935fit2d30935.bin
Number of pixels (horizontal/vertical) =       2463      2527
Integer data: Number of bytes per pixel =  2 (unsigned)
The data has been written in "little endian" format. (Normal for VAX/PCs)
Nominal horizontal pixel size =      100.000 (microns)
Nominal vertical pixel size   =      100.000 (microns)
Pixel number of first output pixel (pixel offsets) =          1         1
