1) in the mlfsom.params and mlfsom.com, change the "set outprefix" 

2) in mlfsom.com, add "awk -f " to the beginning of the line "hkl2XYphi.awk ${tempfile}..." 

3) in README file, "cp 1H87.pdb refine.pdb" should be >> "cp 1H87.pdb refined.pdb"

4) fit2d in the folder was not executable and was replaced with "fit2d_17_006_MacOSX_7_5_intel64"
from the website http://ftp.esrf.eu/pub/expg/FIT2D/

5) in mlfsom.com file, if you turn on "set tempfile = mlfsom_tempfile" and turn off other options
after running mlfsom.com it generates bunch of tempfiles. One of them is
mlfsom_tempfilepristine_Fsqr.hkl. This file has hkl indices along with two columns one of which
is F_squared. Relevant info for ${tempfile}pristine_Fsqr.hkl from mlfsom.com is below:
# format "HKL"  H  K  L sin(theta)/lambda |F+|^2
# format "HKL" -H -K -L sin(theta)/lambda |F-|^2

6) in mlfsom.com, "set terminal table" lines (there are two of them) were changed to "set table" considering the info on 
https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuplot/mailman/message/29227063/. If you do this it will not plot
anything. If you do not change it two error messages appear in the temp file 
mlfsom_tempfileincoherent_scatter. Alternatively, you can comment this line and then plot will be shown using our default
terminal X11. However, one of the error still remains there. 

7) Segmentation fault - raising lines in mlfsom.com:
